## Advanced Neural networks for Fake News detection

### Dataset

We're using Liar dataset, it has 12.8K short sentences collected from Politifact.com.
You can find the dataset in the below link with its preview and summary
https://huggingface.co/datasets/liar

In the code we load it from huggingface by using there "datasets" library.

### How to run

The code is published in Google collab, there are some installations to do in the beginning.
Running the first set of code modules will import all necessary libraries and install required dependencies.
Just follow along by running module by module.

We recommend switching to GPU since it will be faster and take less time for the model to train.
